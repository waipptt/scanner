### 3.1.6 (EDGE, 2014-05-13)

Breaking changes:

  - More and better callbacks to `steroids.layers.popAll`.

Bugfixes:
  - Keyboard that is opened from a drawer WebView no longer stays open after the drawer is closed. Will close [#262](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/262).
  - Closing a drawer with the keyboard no longer destroys the target WebView. Will close [#267](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/267)
  - Fixed a bug where `steroids.drawer.hide` only work when both left and right drawers were defined. Will close [#268](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/268).
  - Steroids.js API calls now function correctly when called via the Cordova `resume` event. Will close [#90](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/90).
  - `steroids.layers.popAll()` now remembers root WebView's navigation bar visibility state correctly. Will close [#295](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/295).
  - Setting a custom back button immediately after a page is pushed no longer causes overlapping buttons. Will close [#145](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/145).
  - Fixed issue where WebView top inset was offset by status bar height after presenting the Cordova Camera. Will close [#296](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/296)

### 3.1.5-p2 (2014-05-08)
