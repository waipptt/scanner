# Stable AppGyver iOS Native Runtime

This document contains the release notes for **stable** releases of the iOS Native Runtime. To see which version of the native runtime each AppGyver component is running, see the [native runtime versions](https://github.com/AppGyver/scanner/blob/master/runtime-versions.md) document. A non-patch version is always accompanied by a new App Store version of the [AppGyver Scanner for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appgyver-scanner/id575076515?mt=8).

**Patch** versions are available via the Build Service to give access to new bugfixes before a new stable version has been approved by Apple â€“ read more in the [native runtime Patch Version guide](https://academy.appgyver.com/categories/2-tooling/contents/119-native-runtime-patch-versions).

For early access to new features and more complex bugfixes, **Edge** versions are available via the Build Service. Read the [native runtime Edge version guide](https://academy.appgyver.com/categories/2-tooling/contents/86-native-runtime-edge-versions) for more information, and see the [changelog](https://github.com/AppGyver/scanner/blob/master/changelog-ios-edge.md) for release notes.

## 4.0.2 (2014-12-18): JSCore crashing fixed and other stability improvements

### Changes
- Speed up Cordova `deviceready` on all iOS devices by changing the way Cordova's plugins are loaded. 

### Features
- Pixate `navigation-bar back-button` has been implemented

### Bugfixes
- MAJOR fix to our JSCore, events are now queued to prevent crashes. Fixes the constant Scanner crashing.
- Livereload did not look for changed files in user files
- Blank page was sometimes shown after splashscreen on Livereload
- Fixed issue with appstore builds being rejected from App Store with Invalid Symlink error.

### Known issues
- Splashscreen on landscape-only builds is displayed wrong [#599](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/599)
- Portrait splashscreen is rotated to landscape if device orientation changes while showing the splashscreen [#594](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/594)
- `steroids.screen.rotate` fires false success callback after trying to rotate to an unallowed direction [#598](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/598)
- `steroids.screen.dismissAlert` is broken after the update of cordova-plugin-dialogs to 0.2.10.
- In a landscape-only build in iOS8 opening the BarCode Scanner renders the screen half gray [#560](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/560)
- Landscape-only builds crash when Cordova Camera is used [#455](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/455)
- When popping layers navigation bar buttons lose the styles defined in `ios.css`. This is a Pixate issue, but adding `font-weight: 300` or any other number to `navigation-bar` in `ios.css` fixes the issue temporarily.

## 4.0.1 (2014-11-04): Support for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+

**Breaking changes:**

  - Requires new graphical assets being defined in the Build Service
- Tab Items use the `id` defined in `application.coffee` for Native CSS.

- Focusing on an input caused an input field being scrolled out of the visible view and it did not come back even when started typing.
- WebView was pushed too far up if an input was at the bottom of the screen and Tab Bar was visible (fixes [#567](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/567)).
- iPad on landscape-only builds displayed a black splashscreen. Closes [#158](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/158)
- In a landscape-only build on iPhone 6+, adding a style class to the navigation bar makes it invisible [#559](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/559)

  (fixes [#550](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/550))
- Keyboard settings can no longer be configured app-wide in `config.ios.xml`.

  while having the keyboard open. (fixes [#467](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/467))
- Fixed typo in Drawer options (strechDrawer -> stretchDrawer)

Known issues:
- In a landscape-only build on iPhone 6+, adding a style class to the navigation bar makes it invisible [#559](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/559)

Known issues:
- In iOS8, taking a screenshot and scrolling clears all webview content due to Apple's base64 bug
- In iOS8, the keyboard accessory bar can not (at least currently) be disabled because of the new predictive text feature in iOS8

##3.1.3 (2014-03-06)

 - Support for programmatically selecting a tab, see [`steroids.tabBar.selectTab`](http://docs.appgyver.com/en/edge/steroids_Steroids%20Native%20UI_steroids.tabBar_tabBar.selectTab.md.html#steroids.tabBar.selectTab)

 - Support for hiding and showing a modal without an animation (see the [`steroids.modal`](http://docs.appgyver.com/en/edge/steroids_Steroids%20Native%20UI_Steroids.modal_index.md.html#steroids.modal) API docs).
