one of these bugfixes.)

Bugfixes:
- `visibilitychange` was fired twice when modal is opened.
- App with tabs or drawer calling `broadcastJavascript`
  while having focus on input field caused unfocus, ie. keyboard disappeared
  (fixes [#626](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/626))
- User Files take precedence over Steroids and Cordova assets when
  retrieving from http://localhost
  (fixes [#597](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/597))

## 4.0.0-edge3 (2014-11-05): Fix a Crosswalk crash

Bugfixes:
- Fix a nasty crash on Crosswalk runtimes.

## 4.0.0-edge2 (2014-11-05): Tab Bar API and View Events

Features:
- Update to Crosswalk 9 with Chromium 38.
- Native Chromium library is temporarily provided for both ARM and Intel x86.
  - This increases the minimum APK filesize of the Crosswalk builds to 34 MB.
    We will soon provide an option to build only for ARM or x86 in the Build Service.
- Implement view related events:
  - `visibilitychange` (requires Steroids.js 3.5.6)
  - `steroids.layers.on/off`
  - `steroids.modal.on/off`
  - `steroids.tabBar.on/off`
- Implement rest of Tab Bar API
  - `steroids.tabBar.replace`
  - `steroids.tabBar.currentTab.update`
- Extended drawer support
  - enable/disable gestures
  - change the drawer size
  - display shadow between the center view and drawer
- Drawer API methods
  - `steroids.drawers.update`
  - `steroids.drawers.show`
  - `steroids.drawers.hide`
  - `steroids.drawers.on/off`
- Support for automated UI test runner.

Bugfixes:
- Replacing layers failed when doing the API call from a WebView which
  was not visible, ie. not added to any layer.
  (fixes [#581](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/581)).
- Fixed three WebView related memory leaks, which will help overall stability.
- Fixed a crash occurring when onPageLoaded callback was invoked for a
  WebView which had already been killed (affected especially slower devices).
- Fixed a crash when changing orientation too rapidly with Crosswalk
  (fixes [#575](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/575))


## 4.0.0-edge1 (2014-10-24): In-place animations

Features:
- In place animations (flip and slide to four directions).
- Complete Layers API
  - `steroids.layers.replace`
  - `steroids.layers.popAll`


## 3.5.4-rc2 (2014-10-23): Fix pushing a preloaded layer

3.5.4-rc2 was released as 3.5.4 (stable).

Bugfixes:
- Pushing a preloaded layer displayed a blank view.
- Destroy splashscreen view after it has been displayed.


## 3.5.4-rc1 (2014-10-21): Splash Screen

Breaking change:
- Native CSS is read from `native-styles/android.css` instead of
  `native-styles/default.css`
  ([#558](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/558)).

Features:
- Display Splashscreen on application start.
  - Splashscreen is displayed for three seconds by default and
    then hid automatically.
  - To gain control over when to hide splashscreen, use `steroids.splashscreen.hide()` and set `AutoHideSplashScreen` to false in `config.android.xml`.
- Cordova assets are no longer copied to internal storage
  in Scanner to speed up the application start. Cordova can now only be loaded from `http://localhost/cordova.js`.
- When application is started with a custom schema,
  the value can be read from `window.AG_APP_STARTUP_URL` ([#141](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/141)).

Bugfixes:
- Not defining `title` or `id` in for Tab Item in application.coffee caused a crash.
- Cordova's `config.(android.).xml` was not properly applied. This caused problems with plugins depending on it (eg. FileTransfer, Urban Airship)
  (fixes [#564](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/564),
   [#533](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/533)).
- Drawer in application.coffee caused a crash.
- Certain null attribute values in application.coffee caused a crash.
- WebView touch events are now disabled when opening a new WebView.
  This previously allowed to eg. invoke several subsequent layers.push() method
  calls by repeatedly tapping a button
  (fixes [#539](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/539)).


## 3.5.4-edge4 (2014-10-13): Reaching Stable Soon

Features:
- Change the whole Native UI styling at once with `steroids.app.loadTheme()`.
- Return a list of all currently preloaded WebViews with `steroids.app.getApplicationState()`.
- Define a Native CSS `id` in application.coffee for Tabs, to allow convenient
  styling of individual Tab Items (eg. setting the icon individually for each Tab).

Bug fixes:
- Showing the soft keyboard on top layer caused flickering.
- Drawer settings in application.coffee caused a crash.
- Status Bar hide/show and rotation from landscape->portrait caused flickering.
- Sending a Post Message caused the recipient view to flicker over the sender
  view (affected only Chromium runtimes).
- Tab Bar sometimes appeared as empty right after application start.
- API `navigation.bar.show()` is now consistent with iOS:
  - Success callback is invoked.
  - Change default to show navigation bar without animation.
- Navigation Bar title no longer disappears if other buttons are set.

Internal:
- Implementation for Composer required GetNSUserDefaults API


## 3.5.4-edge3 (2014-10-08): Native Styling with CSS

Features:
- Style Native UI elements with CSS (Pixate).
  - Define styles in `dist/native-styles/default.css`.
  - API for `setStyle`, `setClass` and `setId`.
  - Supported elements: Navigation Bar, Buttons, Tab Bar.
- Output WebView console.log messages using INFO log level
  (ie. visible on production builds).
- Remove permission `DOWNLOAD_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION` which is no longer needed.
- Set WebView default background color to white.
- Load Scanned Application in an emulator without requiring to scan the QR code.
- Implement API for `steroids.tabBar.update`.

Bug fixes:
- Steroids.on event didn't fire properly on 3.5.4-edge2.
- When using Tab Bar, sometimes a wrong WebView is visible with Chromium
  (fixes [#526](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/526)).
- Loading.html wasn't displayed after starting the application from Initial View.


## 3.5.4-edge2 (2014-09-25): Initial Drawer

**3.5.4-edge2 was hidden from Build Service on 26th September due to the edge being broken and not firing Steroids ready event.**

Features:
- Drawer can be initialized from application.coffee.
- Support window.AG_* constants
  - AG_CLIENT_VERSION
  - AG_APP_STARTUP_URL (only for Scanner currently)
  - AG_WEBVIEW_UUID
  - AG_WEBVIEW_UDID (legacy attribute, will be removed later)
- Scanner version is the code defined in the Build Service.
- Make Cordova's ScrollEvent class available to Cordova plugins.
- Include hardcoded Open GL 2 version in default Android Manifest for
  Google Maps plugin support. This will be fixed properly by providing this is
  as a user configurable option.

Bug fixes:
- Opening two Steroids layers no longer result in two WebViews being created.
- Preloads are no longer loaded before Initial View is dismissed.
- Sending a post message caused a NPE when application was shutting down.
- Resetting application to initial view caused next initial view dismissal to fail.
- Displaying a WebView no longer causes a nasty blink.
- CordovaWebView#reload() expected by plugins is now implemented.


## 3.5.4-edge1 (2014-09-19): Navigation Bar buttons and Initial View

Features:
- Navigation Bar modification methods available:
  - Back button text can be modified and replaced with an image
  - Back button can be overridden

  - Navigation Bar can have multiple custom buttons
    - both image and text are supported
- InitialView can be shown, dismissed and app can be resetted to it
- Status bar onSuccess and onFailure callbacks on show and hide
- Loading.html is shown when WebView is pushing, tabs are loading or a modal is shown.

Known issues:
- Setting a custom back button title makes the nav bar title misalign
- If navigation bar title is set to be an image, it disappears if other buttons have been modified
- Scrolling can be quite clunky at times
- Loading.html does not show after resetting app to InitialView
- Re-download from Scanner crashes the app

## 3.5.3-rc3 (2014-09-16): Return proper 404 errors in http://localhost

Bug fixes:
- Return HTTP 404 Not Found when an asset from http://localhost does not
  exist. Previously "Connection Refused" was the result which caused problems.

  (fixes [#512](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/512))


## 3.5.3-edge4 (2014-09-04): Styled scanner

Features:
- Scanner shares similar outlook with the AppGyver iOS client.
- API for visibilityState returns values according to the WebView's visibility
- Tab bar is displayed on the bottom by default to allow better multiplatform
  consistency. Tab bar position can be changed in the future in `application.coffee`
  and with `steroids.tabBar.update`.

- Navigation bar's visible size stays the same although different devices have
  different pixel-densities.


## 3.5.3-edge3 (2014-09-01): Navigation bar

New naming convention for edge versions: the "p" is now dropped out because too many people
confused stable patch level releases (3.5.2-p2) with edges (3.5.2-edge-p2).
This caused wrong version numbers being reported in bug reports.

Features:
- Navigation bar
  - Back button returns to the previous WebView
  - API calls
