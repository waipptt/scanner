  - Back button text can be modified and replaced with an image
  - Back button can be overridden
  - Navigation Bar can have an image as the title

## 3.5.3-edge3 (2014-09-01): Navigation bar

New naming convention for edge versions: the "p" is now dropped out because too many people
confused stable patch level releases (3.5.2-p2) with edges (3.5.2-edge-p2).
This caused wrong version numbers being reported in bug reports.

Features:
- Navigation bar
  - Back button returns to the previous WebView
  - API calls
    - show / hide the navigation bar

Bug fixes:

  QR code (fixes [#302](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/302))

  for example: pause/resume the app, open the camera.
  (fixes [#503](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/503))
- Exiting the app no longer causes Illegal State Exception
  (fixes [#504](https://github.com/AppGyver/steroids/issues/504))
